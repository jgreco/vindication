README for vindication
======================

  vindication is an input wrapper to "vi-ify" console programs with less
  inspired input schemes.

  More exactly, vindication allows users to use "normal mode" text editing
  features with any console program on linux, interactive or otherwise.


Usage
=====

  `vindication your_command_here`

  For example, `vindication nano` will start GNU Nano running under
  vindication*.  The user may then procede to edit text as usual however upon
  pressing the escape key vindication is put into normal mode.  At this point
  any input is interpreted by vindication and passed on to the underlying
  program.  Currently supported normal mode commands are:

	i, a, A, x, h, j, k, l


  * Clearly this example is contrived as Vi is available for text editing
  tasks on any Unix system making this entirely pointless.  Despite its
  absurdity it makes for a decent example though.
